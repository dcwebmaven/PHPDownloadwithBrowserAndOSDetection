# PHPDownloadwithBrowserAndOSDetection

This PHP script detects a user's browser and operating system and offers them a live "Download" button to download the appropriate software package based on the characteristics of their machine.

The specifications for this project are as follows:

This is building on an earlier project where I created an Acme, Inc. page in PHP which displayed a "Download Now!" link if a user met certain environmental criteria. 

Alter this program to include the Acme C-Clamp template. 

In addition, make the "Download Now!" link live, so that users who click on it download a file of your choice.
